This capstone project was created as part of Prompt Engineering course (Feb 2024 - March 2024) by edureka.co

# Overview
The goal of this capstone project is to create a web application using Streamlit thatenables users to translate text into different languages, convert the translated text tospeech, and download the audio file. The project leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbomodel for translation and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for speech synthesis.

# Project Description
This project aims to develop a system that translates text into various languages andconverts the translated text into speech. The system is designed to be user-friendly andinteractive, allowing users to either enter text directly or upload a file in various formats(PDF, TXT, Excel, CSV). The text is then translated into a language selected by the userfrom a dropdown menu.

# Tasks for Learners:
1. Research Streamlit and Basics:Learn the fundamentals of Streamlit by referring to the officialdocumentation and introductory tutorials.
2. Understand GPT-3.5-turbo for Translation:Research OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo for language translation. Understandinput prompts and usage.
3. Explore gTTS for Text-to-Speech:Investigate the gTTS library for text-to-speech conversion. Learn aboutavailable options.
4. Design User Interface:Plan and design the user interface, considering input elements and layout
5. Implement Language Translation:Write code to take user input, select a language, and use GPT-3.5-turbo fortranslation.
6. Add Text-to-Speech:Implement text-to-speech functionality using gTTS and save the audio file.
7. Incorporate File Upload:Allow users to upload text or PDF files for translation. Implement textextraction.
8. Enhance User Experience:Implement error handling, user-friendly messages, and instructions.
9. Test and Debug:Thoroughly test the application, identifying and fixing any bugs.
10. Deploy Application:Explore deployment options (Heroku, Streamlit Sharing) and deploy the application.

# Submission Guidelines:
Submit the completed code and a documentation file.\
Documentation should explain how to use the app, considerations, and challenges.
